# Metallography

## Grinding
- rounding all corners
- semi auto grinding: 500 -> 800 -> 1000 -> 2400 (30s) -> 4000 (30s) paper
  - significant pressure, two directions, last paper 3-4 directions
    - starting at #1000: rpm = 100
  - cleaning after each step (sample: with much water >> ethanol >> compressed, plate: with wiper)
  - Check the scratch which was made at the previous grinding.

## Auto polishing
- mount sample on sample holder for auto polisher
- cleaning all clothes & polishing sample holder with water / dry it
- 3 um diamond suspension (1 spray every 1 min)
  - 30N (force reduction) / 10min 2 step (total time: 20 min) / 150 rpm

- 1 um diamond suspension (1 spray every 1 min)
  - 1st step: 15N (force reduction) / 10min / 150 rpm
  - 2nd step: 20N (force reduction) / 5min / 150 rpm
  - blue lubricant : stage 8

- cleaning after each step
  - sample: rinsing with ethanol, ultra sonic cleaning, rinsing with ethanol again and drying with compressed air.
  - holder: cleaning with water

- check the surface in OM. If the surface is not good enough, one more step polishing is required.

## Final polishing
- cleaning clothes with water & dry it
- one solution [OPS (100ml) + soap (~5ml)] (much OPS at the beginning and then 1 spray every 1 min)
- 35N (force reduction) / 15 min / 150 rpm
- Right after picking up the sample after finishing polishing, clean the sample one by one: swabbing with cotton
which is soaked in much ethanol+soap, rinsing with ethanol, ultra sonic cleaning, rinsing with ethanol again and
drying with compressed air. Cleaning plate & holder with much water.

**With manual polishing, normally you can get good sample surface with shorter polishing time.**
